## 🎯 Overview

Welcome to **Python Mastery Projects**, a structured portfolio built to demonstrate **complete Python proficiency** — from the fundamentals to advanced real-world applications.

This repository is organized into three progressive levels:
1. 🟢 **Beginner** – Foundational programming concepts and small utilities.  
2. 🟡 **Intermediate** – Real-world applications using APIs, Flask, and automation.  
3. 🔴 **Expert** – Advanced Python integrations, bots, and computer vision systems.

Each project reflects not only syntax knowledge but also **best practices, modular design, and real-world problem solving**.
